The slowest by far the unoptimized code. It took about 3 seconds for that to run. I then optimzed the code by flattening all of the arrays. This cut the time in half to about 1.5 seconds. When I went back to the old code and turned on the compiler optimization, the program now only took 1 second to run, about 1/3 of the original time. When I optimized my flattened code, it took about .25 seconds. That was by far the largest speed increase.
