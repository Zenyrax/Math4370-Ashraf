General (turned in correctly):
* submitted according to lab instructions

Optimization (code and commentary):
* These optimizations were indeed good, but they required you to completely
  change the underlying data structure for each vector -- in many contexts
  you would want the 3D array structure -- how could you optimize the code
  performance while *still* retaining the 3D structure?

* That said, your code optimizations were excellent, and your conclusions were
  accurate.

Debugging:
* Correct debugging -- runs and gives the correct solution.
