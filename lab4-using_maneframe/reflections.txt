A. As the number of subintervals increased by 10, the error would get about 100 times smaller. This pattern kept up until 10,000,000 intervals where the error started to increase once again. This was likely due to a limitation of percision with computable computers. Since the error gets 100 times small with a 10x increase in subintervals and 100 = 10^2, a reasonable value for p would 2. As you increase the intervals by some scalar, c, the error gets c^2 smaller.

B. For each 10x increase in the number of intervals, the time would also get 10x longer. This indicates a linear relationship between the intervals and time complexity, so an appropriate value for p would be 1 for a time complexity of O(n).
